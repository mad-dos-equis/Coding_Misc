Threshold Summary,cstar_med,"Median threshold control rate: The most likely tariff/control rate that would cause exactly 10% consumer welfare loss. If 0.30, then a 30% tariff would likely generate the target 10% welfare loss."
Threshold Summary,cstar_lo95,"95% confidence interval lower bound: There's only a 2.5% chance the true threshold is below this value, accounting for parameter uncertainty."
Threshold Summary,cstar_hi95,"95% confidence interval upper bound: There's only a 2.5% chance the true threshold is above this value, accounting for parameter uncertainty."
Summary Results,CS_med,"Median consumer surplus change: Typical welfare loss to consumers (negative = loss). In currency units of the trade data (e.g., -£2M means £2M consumer welfare loss)."
Summary Results,CS_lo95,"Consumer surplus 95% CI lower bound: Worst-case welfare loss scenario (most negative value in confidence interval)."
Summary Results,CS_hi95,"Consumer surplus 95% CI upper bound: Best-case welfare loss scenario (least negative value in confidence interval)."
Summary Results,fill_med,"Median fill rate: Typical fraction of France's lost trade that other countries capture. 0.75 = other exporters replace 75% of French losses."
Summary Results,fill_lo95,"Fill rate 95% CI lower bound: Minimum likely substitution to other countries (less trade diversion)."
Summary Results,fill_hi95,"Fill rate 95% CI upper bound: Maximum likely substitution to other countries (more trade diversion)."
Summary Results,pass_med,"Median pass-through rate: Typical fraction of the tariff cost passed to consumers as higher prices. 0.60 = consumers pay 60% of tariff cost."
Summary Results,pass_lo95,"Pass-through 95% CI lower bound: Minimum likely price increase (exporters absorb more cost)."
Summary Results,pass_hi95,"Pass-through 95% CI upper bound: Maximum likely price increase (consumers pay more of tariff cost)."
Summary Results,Pidx_med,"Median aggregate price index ratio: Typical overall price increase. 1.08 = 8% increase in aggregate wine prices."
Summary Results,Pidx_lo95,"Price index 95% CI lower bound: Minimum likely overall price increase."
Summary Results,Pidx_hi95,"Price index 95% CI upper bound: Maximum likely overall price increase."
Summary Results,HHI_med,"Median Herfindahl-Hirschman Index: Typical market concentration after policy. Compare to baseline HHI to see if market becomes more/less concentrated."
Summary Results,HHI_lo95,"HHI 95% CI lower bound: Minimum likely market concentration (more competitive outcome)."
Summary Results,HHI_hi95,"HHI 95% CI upper bound: Maximum likely market concentration (less competitive outcome)."
Partner Summary,exporter,"Country identifier: Name of the exporting country (France, Italy, Spain, etc.)."
Partner Summary,c,"Control rate: The tariff/policy rate being analyzed (0.25 = 25% tariff)."
Partner Summary,Q_ratio_med,"Median quantity ratio: Typical ratio of new quantity to baseline quantity. 0.70 = 30% quantity decline; 1.20 = 20% quantity increase."
Partner Summary,Q_new_med,"Median new quantity level: Typical absolute quantity after policy implementation, in original units of the trade data."
Partner Summary,share_new_med,"Median new market share: Typical market share after policy. Compare to original shares to see winners/losers. Values sum to 1 across all exporters."
